#Vectors - Vegas, the statisticians Paradise!
#On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. 
#Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. 
#In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. 
#For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.

#In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). 
#You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. 
#For example:

numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
